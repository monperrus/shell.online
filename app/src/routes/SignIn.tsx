 * "forgot password" link — that link lives on the provider's own page, beside
 * the box the password goes in.
 *
 * The screen still exists rather than redirecting on mount. An automatic
 * redirect makes a signed-out session unable to render anything, which is
 * confusing when someone arrives here by signing out, and impossible to get
 * out of when the provider is down.
