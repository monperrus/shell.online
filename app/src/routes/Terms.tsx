            <p>
              The hosted web app, accounts service and relay are provided free
              of charge, without warranty, on a best-effort basis. Availability,

              Where we offer paid services, they are governed by these Terms
              unless a separate written agreement between you and Vulture Labs
              says otherwise. The liability cap in <Ref id="liability" />{" "}

        <Section id="accounts">
          <p>
            Accounts are optional. <code>shell login</code> links a machine to
            your account; <code>shell logout</code> unlinks it and revokes that
            machine&rsquo;s token.

            Signing up creates a team for you, unless you arrived
            through an invite link, in which case you join the team that
            issued it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A team is a shared workspace, and it is shared in a strong
            sense. <b>Everyone in your team can see every member&rsquo;s
            sessions</b> and can read their comments and handoff history. A
            session has an owner and may have multiple assignees, and
            only they can edit it — but visibility is not restricted that way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone signed in to your account can start processes on any machine
            of yours that allowed browser-started sessions, as described in{" "}
            <Ref id="browser-sessions" />. Keep your account credentials to
            yourself, and invite people to your team only when you mean
            them to see all of this.

            The <code>shell</code> CLI runs the command you give it in a

                A random identifier in <code>machine-id</code>, beside the
                credentials file. It survives logout, so signing in again
                updates that machine&rsquo;s entry rather than adding a second

          <p>
            A background daemon can start and stop terminal sessions on your
            machine at the request of a signed-in browser. It runs only after
            you explicitly agree, once, at <code>shell login</code>. Only an
            explicit yes is recorded; if you decline, you are asked again the
            next time.
          </p>
          <p>
            While browser-started sessions are allowed, the daemon polls the
            accounts service every two seconds, and{" "}
            <b>
              anyone signed in to that account can start processes on that

            about what it means before you agree to it.

          <p>
            You are responsible for what runs on your machines under your

          <p>
            The daemon detects which coding-agent harnesses are installed on the
            machine by looking up their command names on the system{" "}
            <code>PATH</code>: <code>agentknit</code>, <code>claude</code>,{" "}
            <code>codex</code>, <code>hermes</code> and <code>openclaw</code>. It
            does not execute them, does not read their configuration, and does
            not read the contents of your projects or your source files.
            Detection runs once per daemon run.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result of that lookup — the list of which of those five commands
            exist on the machine — is sent to the service, so that the web app
            can tell you which harnesses are available on that machine. That
            list is the whole of what harness discovery produces and the whole
            of what it sends.

              Commands, prompts, and anything else entered at the keyboard are
              sent to the accounts service as you commit them, stored without
              encryption, and can be read and exported by every member of your
              team. That includes anything typed by mistake, such as a
              password or a key pasted into the wrong window.
            </p>

            The recording is of what is entered, not of what the session prints
            back. Terminal output stays inside the end-to-end encrypted stream
            and never reaches us.

            create outside the terminal: session ownership and assignment,
            handoffs, comments, mentions, and notifications. Members of the

          <p>
            A share link plus its password is a bearer capability: whoever holds
            both gets whatever access the session allows. On a session started
            with <code>--read-only</code>, browser input is rejected
            server-side. On any other session, whoever holds the link and the
            password can type into a live process on your machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are responsible for who you give a link and a password to, and
            for what they do with them. We cannot tell whether the person
            holding them is the person you meant to give them to. Sending a link
            and a password is handing over that access; treat it that way, and
            end a session when you no longer want it reachable.
